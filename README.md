# Beasts
Exercises from the Beasts section of Practical Javascript

The testing framework used here is SimpleTest, a minimal test runner that extends [TinyTest](https://github.com/joewalnes/jstinytest).

Most of the changes from TinyTest are cosmetic, but the version of SimpleTest used here does have one substantive change: the _eq_ alias points to _assertStrictEquals_ instead of _assertEquals_ as in the original.
